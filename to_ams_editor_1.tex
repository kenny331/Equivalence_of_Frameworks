\opening{Dear Henri Darmon:}

This is a paper in the field of applied category theory.   It proves that two constructions of a double category of cospans equipped with extra structure are equivalent under certain conditions, and it illustrates the applications of these constructions in a number of fields.   I'm submitting it to you because the AMS website says you're the editor for ``unclassified'' papers at \textsl{Transactions of the American Mathematical Society}, and this paper doesn't fit squarely in the other classifications.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
